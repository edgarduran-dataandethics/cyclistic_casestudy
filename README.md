**Google Data Analytics Capstone: Cyclistic Case Study using SQL and Tableau**

The purpose of this case study was to demonstrate SQL and Tableau for cleaning, transforming, and analyzing bike-share data. Using Tableau and SQL insights, I created an interactive dashboard to perform a descriptive time-series and geospatial analysis of rider behavior, with a focus on business decision-making.

Divvy data was retrieved from [Divvy Bikes index](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) to analyze for the case study as is acceptable per their [data license agreement](https://divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement). The dataset includes unique rider IDs, start time, end times, starting location, ending location, and the longitudinal and latitudinal information for bike stations.

**Business Questions to Answer**
* **How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?** (This is the Question assigned to me per the case study)
* Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
* How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

Inside you will find me going through these specific steps which were inspired by the six steps of the Google Data Analytics process
* ASK: Where I state the business problem and identify the stakeholders.
* PREPARE: Where I go through the beginning steps of setting up the SQL queries. Additionally, it is an early high level exploration of the data to determine next steps in the anlysis and limitations.
* PROCESS: How I set up the data, cleaned it, and transformed it.
* ANALYZE: The process I used to analyze and my thoughts behind it.
* RECOMMENDATIONS: Finally, the trends to respond to the specific question I was tasked to answer, along with additional recommendations.

**Key Highlights**
* Combined and cleaned 5.6M rides (Sept 2024â€“Aug 2025) into a unified dataset.
* Identified seasonal and weekend trends among casual riders vs. consistent commuter use among members.
* Found members accounted for 63% of all rides, but casuals had longer median trip times.
* Created an interactive Tableau dashboard with geospatial, temporal, and KPI insights.
* Recommended flexible pass types (seasonal, weekend, monthly) and corporate partnerships to increase membership and revenue.

* Though the case study only required answering the first question, I extended the analysis to address the others for additional insight

* I learned SQL and Tableau through my Google Analytics Certificate on Coursera and created this project to deepen my applied skills.
